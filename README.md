### Description
I was inspired to write this application by the current difficult situation in the world. Easy-med is a mobile application dedicated to private clinics. It's main functionalities are:
- possibility to diagnose your disease by creating a form about your symptoms and sending it directly to an online chat with a doctor.
- saving the patient's medical history
- notification of taking your medicines
- & others...
I am writing this application in React-native using Expo-package because I want to reach as many recipients as possible. React is also my favorite technology in which I feel very comfortable and enjoy learning new things and trends.  :metal:

### Main Technologies 
- React-native (Expo, React-native-navigation 5+).
- React (Redux, redux-thunk, Hooks).
- React-native-gifted-chat.
- API's (REST-api, Web-socket, Map-handler, Maps Static API, Geocoding API).
- & others...
